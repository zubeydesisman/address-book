#### _ Zubeyde Sisman _

## Description
An address book application using constructors and prototypes.

### Website should have:
Add functionality to record and display a contact's email address.
Add functionality to record and display a contact's physical address.
Then, add functionality that allows a user to record multiple addresses (email or physical) for a single Contact, and what type each address is (ie: "work", "personal", etc.) (Hint: Address will need to be an object with multiple properties saved within the Contact object.)
Remove any additional address fields when the form is submitted. (One way to do this would be to use the not() and remove() functions.)
